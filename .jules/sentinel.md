## 2024-05-24 - [CRITICAL] Prevent Command Injection and Secret Exposure in SSH Automation

**Vulnerability:** Automation scripts (`automation/setup/reconfigure_ksc_service.py`) were generating remote files containing sensitive passwords by dynamically constructing a multiline string and passing it via shell `echo` over an SSH connection. Furthermore, SSH passwords were being passed to `sudo` via shell `echo` piped to `sudo -S`.

**Learning:** Constructing strings for shell execution over SSH makes the system vulnerable to command injection if a secret contains special shell characters like single quotes, semicolons, or ampersands. It also risks exposing plaintext passwords in the remote machine's process table or bash history.

**Prevention:** Always rely on secure file transfer (SFTP/SCP) to write configuration files remotely instead of piping them through shell commands like `echo` or `cat`. Also, use standard `stdin.write()` via your SSH library to pass passwords when executing `sudo -S` dynamically to avoid exposing them on the command line.
